# Notable People Who Inspire Me

I've been thinking a lot about the people who inspire me, specifically those who are well known or famous. The start of this year dawned a new age for me,
both in the literal sense, but also in two very important philosophical ones. The first is related to the literal one, this year I turned thirty. Some
consider this age the "true start of adulthood." To me, it will definitely mark a new chapter in my life. I want the next decade of my life to be more
successful that the last, I want to push the boundaries and step out of my comfort zone, as it were. To that end, I started reflecting on this list of
people who inspire me. In no particular order, here is my short list:

* Elon Musk
* Hank Green
* Larry Page
* Sergey Brin
* Leo LePorte
* Se√°n William McLoughlin (aka Jacksepticeye)

The other interesting aspect of this list is how it has changed in the last decade.
