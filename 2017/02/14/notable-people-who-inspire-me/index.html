          <h1 class="post-title entry-title">Notable People Who Inspire Me</h1>
          <p>I’ve been thinking a lot about the people who inspire me, specifically those who are well known or famous. The start of this year dawned a new age for me, both in the literal sense, but also in two very important philosophical ones. The first is related to the literal one, this year I turned thirty and some consider thirty to be the “true beginning of adulthood.” Second, it will definitely mark a new chapter in my life. I want the next decade of my life to be more successful that the last, I want to push the boundaries and step out of my comfort zone, as it were. To that end, I started reflecting on this list of people who inspire me. In no particular order, here is my short list.</p>
<h3>Elon Musk</h3>
<p>Musk may seem like an obvious and slightly cliche choice, but I admire him wholeheartedly. He has made his fortunes and reinvested them in the future of humanity like no other. He really wants to see us soar to new heights, and while that sound like I’m being cliche again, I mean it quite literally. History will speak of Musk with great reverence.</p>
<h3>Hank &amp; John Green</h3>
<p>The Green brothers built an empire of good from a desire to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/vlogbrothers">reconnect with each other</a>. Now they work to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/crashcourse">educate</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/scishow">people</a>, help <a href="https://www.youtube.com/anmlwndrs">others start</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/sexplanations">intelligent</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/learnhowtoadult">thoughtful</a> YouTube channels, as well as run the <a href="http://www.awesomefoundation.org/en">Awesome Foundation</a>. They also popularized the mantra “don’t forget to be awesome” (DFTBA). Not to mention the fact that John Green is the author of the amazing novel, <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em>. They have touched and inspired so <a href="http://www.nerdfighteria.com/">many people</a> with their works.</p>
<h3>Seán William McLoughlin (aka Jacksepticeye)</h3>
<p>One of the common themes among the people I have chosen for this list is a deep sense of decency. Jack is certainly no exception, he makes money doing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/jacksepticeye">what he loves</a> and mantains a humble attitude. He’s a lot of fun to watch, if you’re into that sort of thing, but if you watch enough of his videos you start to see that he is an honest and caring person. The world needs more Jacksepticeyes in it!</p>
<h3>Larry Page &amp; Sergey Brin</h3>
<p>While founders of Google may again seem a cliche choice, you’re probably wrong about why you think I chose them. Much like Musk, they have a drive to see real advancement in our society. They oversee a number of projects that aim to launch humanity well into the future that we were promised by science fiction and TV. While that seems like a silly thing, the truth is, we need people to work on projects that seem like a long shot, that seem rather far fetched and that help humanity in new and innovative ways.</p>
<h3>Leo LePorte</h3>
<p>LePorte set out to stick it to cable television and provide a <a href="https://twit.tv/">network</a> of truly great entertainment for the tech enthusiasts and nerds. He paved the way for others to do the same and now we sort of take it for granted that we can get great content from people who are not backed by MSM and/or big cable networks.</p>
<h2>Change</h2>
<p>The other interesting aspect of this list is how it has changed in the last decade. The Green brothers got their start only a decade ago, so they would not have been on my list. Jacksepticeye was not a thing a decade ago either. All of the obvious differences aside, what is truly interesting about what has changed is the criteria, even the founders of Google would have been on the list for different reasons as they are on there now. These people are largely on my list for the change they have caused or are causing in humanity in their own way. I’ve been thinking a lot about the quote “be the change you wish to see in the world” (which is apparently not actually a direct quote of Ghandi) and I think these people do a pretty good job of embodying that mantra.</p>
